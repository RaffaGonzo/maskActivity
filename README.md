# Red Is Sus

Our project, Red Is Sus Kinda (RISK) is a practical safety measure for on-campus learning next semester.

While college students arenâ€™t a high-risk population for COVID-19 mortality, they are high-risk for infectivity.  According to a recent study, social distancing is a significant challenge for college-age kids [1] due to the conflict of self-isolation with social life and academic performance. A crowded campus with many such conflicts would have a pressing need to enable students to maintain proper practices.

The RISK mask is designed to help bypass individual willpower by informing the user and everybody around them how at-risk the user is of having contracted COVID. This also creates a quantitative standard of safety, allowing public areas to precisely specify safety requirements.

The mask lights up red, yellow or green depending on the risk associated with its user. Red indicates high risk and is detected through a temperature sensor using skin temperature to check for fever, a common symptom of COVID. Yellow indicates medium risk through recent proximity to high risk or medium risk users. Green indicates low risk with no exposure to higher risk users and no indications of fever in the last 10 days. Each mask keeps track of its own risk level in real time, increasing when exposed to others and decreasing over time if no fever develops. At red and yellow risk levels, it emits a specific radio signal telling nearby masks to increase their risk. At green level, no signal is emitted. 

This mask modification would promote awareness of social distancing and create a peer-driven incentive to self-isolate. Students will most likely break social distancing rules by accident or due to irrational behavior, so reminding students of the danger in real-time and diverting the responsibility from the self to others decreases the risk of outbreaks.
